# π³

This repository contains the control and analysis software for the novel three dimensional beam monitor called π³, developed by the Laboratory of High Energy Physics (LHEP) at the University of Bern.
Also, measurements from the laboratory and first proton beam tests at the Bern medical cyclotron are included.

The software and the measurements in this repository were created in the framework of a bachelor thesis in the spring semester of 2019, which is also stored in this repository.
